# videocall

We follow two tutorials to learn aborut sockets, peerjs and webRTC, the first involves videocall and the second screen share.

## Instructions first tutorial

* The prerequisites are: node, npm and peerjs installed, and, in this case, both ports free (3000 adn 3001).

* For running the app we first need to install all dependencies:

> `npm i`

* After that we run the peer server:

> `peerjs --port 3001`

* Finally run the server:

> `npm run devstart`

## Second tutorial

With the second tutorial we made a similar app to share video and also share screen.

To run it we run the command:

> `node server2.js`

After that we go to the folder that contains the client app:

> `cd client`

Finally we install it and run the app:

> `npm i`
> `npm start`
